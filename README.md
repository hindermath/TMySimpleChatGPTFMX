# TMySimpleChatGPTClient
A simple DELPHI Firemonkey ChatGPT client.

The controls are mostly based on FNC components from TMSSoftware (see https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmsfncstudio.asp). This was the fastest way for me to connect to the OpenAI TEST API.
Furthermore, I use this application as an example program to familiarize myself with these controls, since I bought them.
If I have some time left in my little free time, I try to find a solution that provides an alternative to the FNC components of TMSSoftware. But in the near future for the time being (unfortunately) not.
